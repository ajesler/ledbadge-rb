Text Protocol Documentation

The manufacturers program appears to send a message of length 250, regardless of the actual message size. Looks like it pads with 0x00 characters.  

Fonts:

By default, the normal font is used. You do no need a prefix on the message to specify normal font. 
If you want to use a bold font, 0xff0x81 is used to indicate that the following text should be bold. To switch back to normal text, use 0xff0x80.

Eg 

0d 41 ff 81 42 ff 80 43 ff 81 44 ff 80 45 == A bold B normal C bold D normal E


Special Characters
These are two bytes, the first of which is \c0.
Seems to be depended on something unknown, as multiple sequences produce the same character, but may change depending on what else is being sent.


Multiple Messages
Each message has an address offset ? Each contains 4 blocks of 64 bytes that can be written to. 
The following are the initial addresses for each message.
06 00 
07 00
08 00
09 00
0a 00
0b 00


Closing sequence
[0x02,0x33,0x01] - used when only one message
[0x02,0x33,0x07] - used when three messages being written

the last byte int the above array is a byte with the number of set bits indicating the number of messages written

01 = 1
03 = 2
07 = 3
0f = 4
1f = 5
3f = 6
7f = 7
ff = 8
