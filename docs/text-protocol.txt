Text Protocol Documentation

Fonts:

By default, the normal font is used. You do no need a prefix on the message to specify normal font. 
If you want to use a bold font, 0xff0x81 is used to indicate that the following text should be bold. To switch back to normal text, use 0xff0x80.

Eg 

0d 41 ff 81 42 ff 80 43 ff 81 44 ff 80 45 == A bold B normal C bold D normal E


Special Characters?
When using special charactes, are both forms of the character written to memory each time? Doesnt seem like they are stored on the badge.
